    <h1>About Jordan Bank</h1>
    <div class ='about'>
    <h4>A 2033 graduate of Hollywood Upstairs Medical College, Jordan Bank realized his passion for medicine on the battlefield in World War IV. Using his free tuition and abundance of time after the destruction of New York City, Jordan opted for seven brutal and unforgiving years of medical school instead of getting his PTSD treated. Now, he brings his talents to a world of few remaining doctors.</h4>
    <p>To his chagrin, Dr. Jordan Bank & Associates takes most health insurance.</p>
