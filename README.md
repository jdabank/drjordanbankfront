# Details     

This will be the front end of the project, built in Vue, using two models (appointments and insurnace) in a Django backend. It will be a mockup of a doctor's website with a patient portal.

# Vue

This project is built in Vue 3, incorporating ref, reactive, and mounting. Page switching is super easy in view with mounting - all that stuff just has to be in script setup and not script.

# Firebase

I have the app deployed to Firebase - which is SO much easier than Heruko. I also set up user authentication through Firebase, but it only works locally and not on the deploy, making it very difficult to fix the problem. The problem is not present on my machine.
